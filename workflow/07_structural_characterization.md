# 07 – Structural characterization of novel isoforms

Putative protein products derived from novel transcript isoforms identified in
target genes were characterized in silico in order to explore their potential
structural and functional features.

This analysis focused on predicted protein sequences, domain architecture and
structural organization.

## Translation of novel transcript isoforms

Novel transcript sequences were translated into amino acid sequences using the
**ExPASy Translate tool**
(https://web.expasy.org/translate/).

Translated protein sequences were used as input for downstream structural and
functional analyses.

## Protein structure prediction

Predicted protein sequences were analyzed using the **AlphaFold Protein Structure
Database** and AlphaFold server
(https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk) to obtain three-dimensional structural models.

Predicted models were inspected to evaluate overall folding and structural
differences relative to canonical isoforms.

## Prediction of signal peptides and transmembrane domains

The presence of signal peptides and transmembrane regions was assessed using
**Phobius**
(https://phobius.sbc.su.se), a tool for combined signal peptide and transmembrane
topology prediction.

---

## Protein domain annotation

Protein domain architecture was analyzed by querying predicted protein sequences
against domain databases via **InterPro** through **UniProt**
(https://www.uniprot.org).

This analysis enabled the identification of conserved domains and functional
motifs potentially affected by alternative splicing.
