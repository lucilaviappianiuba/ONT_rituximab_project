# ONT_rituximab_project
Bioinformatic pipeline for ONT long-read transcriptome analysis of therapeutic targets in pediatric B-cell ALL.

The workflow includes:
- Quality control and filtering of ONT reads
- Alignment to the human genome and transcriptome (GRCh38)
- Transcript-level quantification 
- Molecular subtype classification of pediatric B-cell ALL
- Isoform discovery
- Structural characterization of novel isoforms
